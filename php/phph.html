  <p> 
  PHP, an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language. It is a cross-platform, HTML-embedded server-side scripting language and is especially suited for web development.

	    <h3>Where</h3>

			<ul style="list-style-type:hand">
<li>Server-side means that PHP scripts execute on the Web server, not within the browser on your local machine.</li>
<li>Cross-platform means that PHP scripts can run on many different operating systems and Web servers. PHP is available for the two most popular Web  
    server configurations IIS and Apache.</li>
<li>HTML embedded scripting language means that PHP statements and commands are actually embedded in your HTML documents. When the Web server sees the PHP statements in the Web page, the server executes the statements and sends the resulting output along with the rest of the HTML.</li>
<li> PHP commands are parsed by the server much like Active Server Pages or Cold Fusion tags.</li>


	 </ul>
	  </p>
	 <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
<p>The basic syntax of PHP is similar to C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. PHP is used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages quickly, but you can do much more with PHP.
	</p>
	<h3>A simple example</h3>
	<div class="block">
	 		   <xmp>
		<html>
		<head> 
		<title>First PHP example</title>
		</head>
		<body> 
		<?php  
		echo "This is a simple PHP script!"; 
		?>
		</body>
		</html>
		   </xmp>
		</div>
			<p>
				In the above example we have written a HTML script with some embedded code to display some text. The PHP code is enclosed in special start (<?php) and end (?>) tags that allows to go in and out of PHP mode. The extension of a php file is ".php".
			</p>
